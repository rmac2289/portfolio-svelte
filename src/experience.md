I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Axos Bank in
San Diego, working mainly on test automation and testing metrics. During my first few months at the bank I established myself as a leader within the testing team. I took the initiative to expand on our automation framework, Testim.io, by building out a Node.js/Express API that fed our testing data into an Elasticsearch cluster. Within Elasticsearch I then visualized the data using Kibana, so internal teams could see how their applications were performaing in both production and test environments. In addition to gathering data on applications, I also created a pipeline to ingest metadata from the testing framework itself, allowing the team to see how efficiently we were
using it.

In my free time I enjoy coding full-stack web applications. I regularly work with React, Node.js, SQL and NoSQL Databases (mainly Postgres & MongoDB), REST & GraphQL APIs, and of
course HTML & CSS. I've recently branched out on the front-end - I picked up Vue fairly quickly and started working with Svelte (which is what I rebuilt this site with!), as well
as the back-end - I've been refactoring my "Find Your Park" app from a REST to a GraphQL API. In addition to the web, I've published a mobile version of one of my apps to Apple's app store using React Native, and I have another in production.

I genuinely love to program - creating something from nothing is just
awesome. On the other hand, digging deep into somebody elses code to figure out how it works or to troubleshoot a problem is equally rewarding. I find the process of learning new technologies both exciting and humbling - the software development field has a way of telling you how little you truly know and how much more knowledge there will always be to gain.

**Fun Fact:** I worked for nearly 5 years as a 911 Emergency Dispatcher. This experience has taught me how to be an oustanding communicator with both co-workers and the public, as well as how to remain calm and deliver results under stressful circumstances.
